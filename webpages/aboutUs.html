# Citizens-Assist

Citizens Assist is an online portal for raising issues which allows citizens to report various problems in their city as well as allowing them to view the status of the problem. Any community issues can be raised with a few taps on your smartphone screen. You have the option to use GPS to mark the position of the issue or search for a location. Other functionalities include viewing issues that you raised, viewing all issues which can be sorted by type, area, severity, etc. Additionally, one can also look at trends based on the issues raised and resolved.
